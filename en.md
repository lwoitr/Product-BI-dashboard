## 🚀 Outcome & Business Value

The developed product dashboard enables the business to move  
from descriptive reporting to **data-driven decision making**.

With it, teams can:

- identify products and categories with negative performance metrics
- track how categories and products change over time
- make informed decisions on discontinuing or scaling products
- quickly generate analytical slices for ad-hoc analysis

The dashboard reduces reliance on manual reporting and speeds up  
product decision-making by providing a single source of truth.
